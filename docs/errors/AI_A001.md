# AI_A001 - Aspect must have valid signature
---
This error occurs when the aspect class signature does not conform with the following rules:
- Aspect must not be generic
- Aspect must not be abstract
- Aspect must not be static
- Aspect must be public

Example of valid aspect class definition:
```c#
[Aspect(Scope.Global)]
public class MyAspect
{
  //advices
}
```
